Comprehensive Project Update
1. Artifactory Migration Challenges

Current Status: The mobile build pipeline is encountering delays at the "NPM Install" step in the ADO pipeline linked to SaaS Artifactory. This has disrupted testing and downstream pipeline stages.
Actions Taken: An incident ticket has been raised with the tools team to address the issue, which has persisted since August 2024. Further investigations are underway to assess agent configurations and pipeline reliability.

2. Ansible Job Templates Update

Achievements: The deployment of SaaS Artifactory during R74 was successfully executed.
Next Steps: Updates to the Ansible job templates for QA are being led by Rahul Vala and Prudvi Garapati, with completion expected by December 6th. Support is available to ensure this deadline is met.
3. Mobile Build Pipeline Optimization

Progress Made: Environmental variable adjustments have significantly enhanced pipeline performance, enabling progress on the Android build. The iOS build is scheduled for focus next, with a comprehensive update anticipated by Monday.
Stabilization Efforts: A reliable agent from the pool has been identified to minimize disruptions, although occasional freezes require intervention from the tools team.
4. CMS Updates on Track

Timeline Adherence: The CMS updates are progressing as scheduled and are confidently projected for completion by Friday.
5. Key Focus Areas Moving Forward

Ongoing collaboration with the tools team to resolve pipeline inconsistencies.
Timely finalization of QA template updates and CMS changes.
Continued optimization of mobile build processes, with priority on stabilizing the iOS build.
